                <p>
                    One day, I was just using instagram until I received a follow request from a girl. I was thinking it was her but I was still doubting. She found out it was me and that was the first time talking properly.

                <p>
                    The second day of us talking properly I asked her if she was the girl I was texting. She didn't want to reveal that she was the girl who I was texting. Asking her that question felt really weird and both of us were like really akward at that time.
